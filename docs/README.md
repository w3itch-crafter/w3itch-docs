## What is w3itch.io?

W3itch.io is a free-as-freedom open marketplace for independent game creators inspired by [itch](https://itch.io/) and [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/). It’s a community that enables anyone to sell the content they've created. As a seller you’re in charge of how it’s done: you set the price, you run sales, and you design your pages. Benefit from decentralized storage technology, it’s never necessary to get votes, likes, or follows to get your content approved, and you can make changes to how you distribute your work as frequently as you like. W3itch.io is also a collection of some of the most unique, interesting, and independent creations you'll find on the web. We're not your typical digital storefront, with a wide range of both paid and free content, we encourage you to look around and see what you find. Unlike itch, w3itch focus on putting status-of-quote web3 technology into production level services, that is, the community will be encouraged to use web3 technologies such as did, nft, decentralized storage, social token, direct cryptocurrency payment, and etc.

## For Creators

W3itch.io gives creators the tools to make smart choices about how they distribute their content. Creators have access to detailed analytics about how people discover, download, or play what they've created. Our creator dashboard gives easy access to data about what uploads resonate the most or what links drive the most attention.

We believe in making it easy for creators to collect money for their creations in a non-obtrusive way. No matter how large or small the project, it should be simple for fans to donate or pay what they think is fair.

Every creator is unique, so we support a wide range of methods to help them make a living including cryptocurrency. All purchases and donations on w3itch.io are pay-what-you-want above the minimum. The minimum price can be set to zero: it’s free, but fans can choose to support the creator if they like what they're offering. The creator can also define the content access and open revenue sharing mechanism based on their favor.

W3itch.io supports pre-orders, selling rewards, nft rewards, revenue sharing based on the creator's social token even doing crowdfunding with your social token as well. Details can be found in later chapters.

## Content Access Mechanism



## Open Revenue Sharing Mechanism

As web3 technology matures and we have new tools for implementing new payment methods, and the traditional copyright and the way of profit sharing should also be challenged in our era:

- We hope that more profits go directly to each creators in the production chain instead of rent-seeking through other middlemenl.
- We hope that the payment flow to instantly reflect each participant's contribution to the creative process over different life cycle.
- We hope that all readers and fans, will be inspired by the process of spreading and discovering underrated creations.

All of the above things can be achieved by creating a open free market market for creations based on equity tokens represents these works, or their creators.
