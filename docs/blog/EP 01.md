If you'd like to cite a game website that best fits the spirit of indie games, and the ethos of open source software. I would definitely recommend you to take a look at itch.io. If you are interested in [the lawsuit between Epic and Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple), you have probably heard this name. For those who are not familiar with it, itch.io is a website for users to host, sell and download indie games. Released in March 2013 by Leaf Corcoran, the service hosts over 500,000 games and items (assets, ebooks, music) as of April 2022. Itch.io also allows users to host game jams, events where participants have limited time (usually 1–3 days) to create a game. Itch.io has also played its part in supporting [the racial justice and equality movement](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality), and [the Ukraine War](https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine).

But at the same time, we also saw [this tweet:](https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1490141815294414856)

> A few have asked about our stance on NFTs:
> NFTs are a scam. If you think they are legitimately useful for anything other than the exploitation of creators, financial scams, and the destruction of the planet the we ask that please reevaluate your life choices.
> Peace ✌️

As developers who believing in this technology, it is worth mentioning that most of [the current stigmatizations of Web3 and Crypto](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/web3-bullshit.html) are not simply due to bias, but are true. We also believe that any debate is useless at this moment.

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
> —— Linus Torvalds

But what do we get if itch.io embraces with web3? Perhaps the only way to clarify our thoughts, as Linus Torvalds' famouse quote, is to implement it. With this in mind, we start our journey that is now known as w3itch.io.

## Why Game?

> You can create art and beauty on a computer.
> —— Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution 

Any era has its own form of art. In Ancient Greece we had epic poetry, in Renaissance we had painting, sculpture, literature and etc. Although still controversial, [video games could be seen as an art form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_as_an_art_form). Generations of game designers have been exploring the expression of game art. We have [Metal Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_(video_game)), [The Last of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us), as well as [Monument Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley_(video_game)), [To the Moon]() and [Yume Nikki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yume_Nikki). From one man's independent work to a 3A masterpiece in game industry, each of them has their own unique aesthetic value and become a part of a common memory of our generation.

Different from other art forms, games, like movies and open source software, need a group of people, even a game industry to achieve it, and even for indie games, it is an increasingly difficult to rely on just one man to get everything done. It will be a perfect place to experiment with web3 technologies as a way to solve [coordination scalability](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/).

## Why RM2k/2k3?

The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step, we decided to support RM2k/2k3 at the very beginning. There are several reasons for this:

- Retrogaming Culture: The first reason is, we all like old school [retrogaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrogaming), RM2k3 Restrict users to use 256 colors only. Make these works look stylized. Like [MS-DOS](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games) and [Flash Games](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_flash_games), some of these games as a cultural heritage, is being lost rapidly. Let them be in a new kind of medium could save and preserve this kind of cultural heritage for hour children.

- Active global communities: Perhaps more than most of us could ever imagined, RM2k/2k3 has a global decentralized community that is still active today! In its birthplace Japan, probably one of the most active communities is [VIPRPG](https://mimidoshima.wordpress.com/2019/03/02/medetee/), it is well known as hosts several Game Jam every year. Rpgmaker.net is one of the biggest community in English-spearking community, and people are still make new games based on this ancient game engine. We also have [rmarchiv.de](https://rmarchiv.de/games/1092)，[rpg-atelier.net](https://www.rpg-atelier.net/index.php?site=showgame&gid=729) and [rpg-studio.org](http://www.rpg-studio.org/forum/index.php) in German. Some of the the coolest third party patch, was was born from here. We also have [rpg-maker.fr](https://www.rpg-maker.fr/) in France, [rpg.blue](https://rpg.blue/) in China mainland, [taiwanrpgplayer](https://sites.google.com/site/taiwanrpgplayer/home) in Taiwan, etcs and etcs. Each of them has their own unique flavor and culture.

But the most important reason is, we have easyrpg! This open source tool gives a new charm to this old school game engine. Next week, we are going to introducing easyrpg, and explain what we could been benefits from it.
