# W3itch Weekly Telegraph Ep.4 —— Minetest

# English 

Thanks for the long wait, we've just passed a busy month ...

## What's new in [v0.4.3](https://github.com/w3itch-crafter/w3itch-frontend/pull/306)

### GR14

First, [we are participating in GR14 on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/5744/w3itch), it is still going on and one dollar can also help us make our voice heard by the entire web3 community.

### New Project Type - Downloadable Content

We also add a downloadable content as a new type project, this is not a huge amount of work, but it expands our possibilities significantly.

### New Project Type - Minetest

You might already found this. [The most important milestones of the recent release is that we support Minetest besides EasyRPG](https://github.com/w3itch-crafter/w3itch-frontend/issues/181) as our second project type. And by the way, we also add automatically type project detection to save your life.

At the end of Ep.3 we mentioned we are doing some research on UGC and sandbox game and we found [Harvest Moon A new Life](https://w3itch.io/game/221) from a German community, which made by one single indie developer called [MerlinXLL](https://www.multimediaxis.de/threads/125614-.-Harvest-Moon-A-new-Life-.) over ten years ago. 

This game is very well done, you can see not only the change of four seasons, but also can doing some farming in the game. And we do believe if we add ynoproject in combination with it, we might be able to make an online collaborative sandbox space for our community. Unfortunately, although German is not really a barrier, RM03 does not have a scripting language so all functions in [Harvest Moon A new Life](https://w3itch.io/game/221) can only be implemented via common events, which made it extremely difficult to understand the design.

But fortunately, we found Minetest...
## Minetest

### What is Minetest

Minetest is an open source voxel engine, similar to MineCraft, but like EasyRPG is open source software that uses CPP on the bottom, and has a lively community as well. In terms of gameplay, Minetest doesn't exactly inherit from MineCraft, they use Lua as the scripting language for the modules, and the modules are first class citizens in MineTest, this design makes MineTest more scalable in its category, so MineTest isn't just a game, you can treat it as a game You can use it as a game engine, or even use Minetest to participate in LD Game Jam.

Some of the ugc and co-creation features that we want to implement in EasyRPG would require a lot of modifications to the client and game project code, but in MineTest the support is straightforward.

Minetest has a very active community and a module site —— [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/), which shares many similarities in design to [w3itch](https://w3itch.io/), and its author [@rubenwardy](https://github.com/rubenwardy) even wrote [an article](https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2022/03/24/contentdb/) about its design.

### Minetest in WASM
Thanks to WASM technology, the ability to run EasyRPG-supported projects in the browser was an important basis for the creation of ynoproject, and once MineTest could also run in the browser, it was easy to interact with the various web3 infrastructures in the browser environment. Minetest is a complex project, and compiling it into WASM is no easy task.

[Fortunately, someone in the community has already done this for the Minetest community!](https://blog.minetest.net/2022/03/27/March/).

And we might have a huge update around Q3.

### Minetest in W3itch.io



# 中文版

感谢大家长久以来的等待，新一期的通讯总算和大家见面啦。[我们正在参加这一期的 Gitcoin Grant](https://gitcoin.co/grants/5744/w3itch)，一美元也可以让整个 web3 社区听到我们的声音。[这段时间的最重要的里程碑，就是我们支持了 Minetest 并成为我们除了 EasyRPG 之外第二个支持的项目类型](https://github.com/w3itch-crafter/w3itch-frontend/issues/181)。

在上一期通讯的结尾，我们提到了 ugc 类型的游戏，我们从非常多的 rpgmaker 游戏中发现了一款
十年前制作的牧场物语同人。这款游戏的完成度非常高，不仅有四季变换，甚至连种田的功能都实现了。如果我们使用 ynoproject 与之结合，也许可以做成一个线上的协作空间。

遗憾的是，虽然德文并不是一个真正意义上的障碍，但是 RM03 没有脚本语言，所有的功能都只能通过 common event 实现，极大的增大了我们对工程的理解。于是我们只能开始新的寻找。

就在这个过程中我们发现了 Minetest。

## What is Minetest

Minetest 是一个开源的体素引擎，类似 MineCraft，但是和 EasyRPG 一样是底层使用 CPP 的开源软件，并且同样有一个热闹的社区。在玩法上，Minetest 并不完全承袭 MineCraft，它们使用 Lua 作为模组的脚本语言，模组在 MineTest 中是一等公民，这种设计是的 MineTest 在同类游戏中具有更好的可扩展性，因此 MineTest 也并不单纯只是一款游戏，你完全可以将其当做一个游戏引擎来使用，甚至使用 MineTest 参加 LD Jam。

像是一些 ugc 和共创的 feature，如果我们想在 EasyRPG 中实现的话，客户端和游戏工程的代码都需要进行非常多的修改，但是在 MineTest 中这些支持都是直接的。

Minetest 拥有一个非常活跃的社区和一个模组网站，ContentDB，ContentDB 在设计上和 W3itch 也有许多相似之处，它的作者 [@rubenwardy](https://github.com/rubenwardy) 专门写了 [一篇文章](https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2022/03/24/contentdb/) 介绍了它的设计。

## Minetest in WASM

多亏了 WASM 技术，能够让 EasyRPG 所支持的工程在浏览器中运行，这也是 ynoproject 能够诞生的重要基础，一旦 MineTest 也可以在浏览器中运行，我们就可以很容易的与浏览器环境中的各种 web3 基础设施进行互动。MineTest 是一个复杂的工程，将他编译成 WASM 绝非易事。

幸运的事，社区中已经有人实现了这件事。
