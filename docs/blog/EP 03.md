What are the best top 10 RPG Maker games? Everyone may have their answer in mind. Regardless of the ranking, I'm pretty sure Yume Nikki must have a place in this list.

Yume Nikki (ゆめにっき, lit. Dream Diary) is an adventure game by pseudonymous Japanese developer Kikiyama. The player explore the dreams of the protagonist Madotsuki and encounter a number of surrealistic locations and creatures. The game was created using RPG Maker 2003, but lacks most elements commonly associated with role-playing games such as combat and quests. The game's primary objective is to collect items known as "effects" that grant Madotsuki new abilities and allow the player to progress to new areas, with the game ending after 24 of them have been collected.

The reception of the games are polarized. For those encountering Yume Nikki for their first time, the gameplay looks weird. The map and music filled with circulation, and the light is very dim in most cases. You could collect some items, but the vast majority of them are meaningless. This sense of emptiness builds the entire experience of the game, making you feel, at most moments in the game, that everything you do in the game is meaningless. But it is this sense of emptiness that is the most important experience in the entire game narrative, it creates a unique aesthetic that is hardly reconstruct by any other art form. (Perhaps in terms of the game experience, the most similar game before Yume Nikki is [Serial Experiments Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain), there is  even a doujin video called [Yume Nikki Lain OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgiBRyn9UMs).)

Like [Earthbound](https://rpgmakerhistoria.home.blog/2021/12/05/a-history-on-rpg-maker-earthbound-likes-and-fan-games-part-one/), [Pokemonn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zptti2kJpk&ab_channel=aDrive) and [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Touhou_Project_fangames), Yume Nikki also has their own fan games community. Perhaps the most famous fan game among them is Yume 2kki (ゆめ2っき). Unlike the name implies, Yume 2kki is not a official sequel, this is a community-driven yume nikki fan game, the developers of the game for a group of people. The first release of Yume 2kki is in 2007, and like EasyRPG, it is still alive and active!

Yume Nikki fan games also has a global community like RPG Maker. Every year, there are many excellent works born. They build wiki, bbs and blog to traced these fan games and their update. [Dream Diary Jam](https://itch.io/jam/dream-diary-jam-5) is an annual game jam about Yume Nikki fan games.

In the words of Roland Barthes, sometimes ["The Death of the Author"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author) is a good thing for fans. Different from [Earthbound](https://rpgmakerhistoria.home.blog/2021/12/05/a-history-on-rpg-maker-earthbound-likes-and-fan-games-part-one/) and [Pokemonn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zptti2kJpk&ab_channel=aDrive), Yume Nikki itself is a free game, any one can download it for free. Because of this, those fan games maker have less constraint in designing their fan games. (Perhaps even fewer restrictions than [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Touhou_Project_fangames).)

## Yume Nikki Online Project

Ynoproject, which stands for Project Yume Nikki Online, is an open-source software based on EasyRPG. In addition to Yume Nikki and some of its derivatives, it can also run other works developed with RPG Maker 2000/2003 as well.

After open source the original version of ynoproject, its creator [twig33](https://github.com/twig33), like Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from the Internet around Nov. 2021 after some minor bug fixes.

The legacy code still inspires the community, since then, more and more developers have joined the development. There are two major versions of the client code exists today.

Another version in developed by Yumeboo.ru at this discord. It has a in-game chat interface, and a completely rewritten server using nodejs that can be compiled once and deploy a bundle of games at the same time.

## EasyRPG Multiplayer Project

Ynoproject brings a brand new gaming experience to the original Yume Nikki fan games. **Usually speaking, these games need to be explored by yourself, and sometimes this experience is a little bit lonely**. Ynoproject makes them look more lively and less lonely, even though it may undermine the original author's design intent. In ordr to maintain the original flavor of the fan games as much as possible, technically speaking the original Ynoproject just renders the avatar of other players in the map, does not involve any interaction between players, make it more like an online chat room.

Some developers are beginning to think about the potential of this architecture, such as building virtual online spaces like meeting room, meetup event, game jam, and even NFT art galleries, make its experiences closer to those of traditional mmorpg games. Even adding more UGC elements to make it look like [The Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims), [Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing) and even [Roblox]().

Developers from both communities are collaborating and discussing this potential in this [discord channel](https://discord.gg/py4hYZnWMV). They are trying to abstract the [API requirements in EasyRPG](https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/issues/2722) in order to design a better architecture of EasyRPG Multiplayer Project in future.

So is there any rpgmaker game with UGC content inside? In next week, we are going to introduced an ancient fan game of Harvest Moon serious in RPG maker 2003 so called [Harvest moon – a new life](https://w3itch.io/game/221).
