# Week 1 - April 1, 2022

Exploring web3 technologies in itch.io-like scenarios

## What we are working on

1. We've set up an EasyRPG dev server.
2. We've started running some infrastructures like databases, caching service, logging service etc. 
3. Initial research on [itch.io open source client ](https://github.com/itchio/itch) & [GameJolt](https://github.com/gamejolt/gamejolt)
4. Register & Login
5. Creator Dashboard & "Create new project" Form
6. Browse Game
7. Tag API
8. User profile page
9. Fleek Integration

### Why we built from scratch instead of on top of the GameJolt open source project 

We believe that the community is not the IM/channel/server itself. It is more in line with our philosophy that existing communities can use our services without having to migrate to the territory we are preparing.

## Next

1. Handle the charset of the game file
2. Investigate alternatives to [RTP](https://easyrpg.org/rtp-replacement/)
3. Tag Integration
4. Rating API & Page
5. Disqus Integration
