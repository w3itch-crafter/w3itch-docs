- Auto-detect encoding of game files
   
    - Some game packages contain diverse file encodings, and the logic of automatic detection does not work well, so it is better to guide the creators to handle the uploaded packages themselves.
    - For the sake of efficiency the sampling method was used , and it is possible to miss files with different encodings if they exist. And if judging the encoding of each file is not necessary for most games. In case of new games, it is recommended to use the resources suggested by EasyRPG Project to unify file naming and encoding.
