# Q2
## Week 1
Apr. 3rd - 10th, 2022
Exploring web3 technologies in itch.io-like scenarios.
- Why we built from scratch instead of on top of the GameJolt open source project?
- We believe that the community is not the IM/channel/server itself. It is more in line with our philosophy that existing communities can use our services without having to migrate to the territory we are preparing.

### This Week

1. We've set up an EasyRPG dev server.
2. We've started running some infrastructures like databases, caching service, logging service etc. 
3. Initial research on [itch.io open source client](https://github.com/itchio/itch) & [GameJolt](https://github.com/gamejolt/gamejolt).
4. Register & Login
5. Creator Dashboard & "Create new project" Form
6. Browse Game
7. Tag API
8. User profile page
9. Fleek Integration

## Week 2
Apr. 10th - 17th

We believe that scoring, tagging, and commenting may be completely different under different aggregation perspectives and should be governed by the community, which will be an application scenario of DAO.

### This Week

1. Handle the charset of the game file
2. Investigate alternatives to [RTP](https://easyrpg.org/rtp-replacement/).We do not provide official RTP even if there are resources that cannot be found

## Week 5
May. 1st - 8th
[W3itch Weekly Telegraph Ep.2 â€”â€” EasyRPG](https://blog.w3itch.io/2022/04/29/W3itch-Weekly-Telegraph-Ep-2/)

### This Week

- ðŸŽ‰ W3itch V0.2.0 Released ðŸŽ‰
    - [BE](https://github.com/w3itch-crafter/w3itch-backend/releases/tag/v0.2.0) | [FE](https://github.com/w3itch-crafter/w3itch-frontend/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
- Give up direct access to [Fleek](https://fleek.co/)ï¼Œfor better uploading experience. 
    - We use [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) now.
        - Yes, it's not a Web3 technology, but until we find a better decentralized storage and CDN solution, we're "backing off" here for a better upload experience.
    - But that doesn't mean we've given up on exploring decentralized storage. We will try to use [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) to meet the needs of those who want their games and materials to be stored permanently.
    - In fact, it is not necessary to go through our server to do this. Creators can try [ArDrive](https://ardrive.io/) to upload game resources.
        - We will then try to build services to index and cache these resources to make them available to w3itch.io.
    - The way Web3 works is that you don't need to **trust** the service, you should **verify** every part of the service.
    -  So we embrace open source and blockchain.

### Next

- [Vote: Dev Route Selection](https://discord.gg/xeymBbMrBG)
    - More Web2 perks or Web3 perks?
- Account binding
    - We spent extra time on storage issues this week, so this issue was postponed.
    - Main impact: GitHub registered users have to bind their wallets to get token to unlock some games.
- Auto-detect encoding of game files
    - We encountered resources whose zip package charset and file charset did not match, and where multiple encodings of the files existed at the same time. This problem is more complex than we expected.
    - This may require the creator to also follow some sort of convention and try to package the game in UTF-8.

## Week 6, 
May. 8th - 15th

[W3itch Weekly Telegraph Ep.3 â€”â€” Yume Nikki Online Project](https://blog.w3itch.io/2022/05/10/W3itch-Weekly-Telegraph-Ep-3/)

### This Week
- Search
    - Add integrated google search to our website
    - We use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to improve our performance on google search
- Ynoproject Demo
    - https://ynoproject.testenv.w3itch.io/
    - [How to set up Ynoproject with forest-orb on your server](https://hackmd.io/0iqmvleUT4W1V5T5bM2WJg)
- CI/CD
    - Now we use [Drone](https://www.drone.io/) to build,test and release `w3itch-backend`
   
    - > Drone by Harnessâ„¢ is a modern Continuous Integration platform that empowers busy teams to automate their build, test and release workflows using a powerful, cloud native pipeline engine.
    - [Visit our Drone platform](https://drone.w3itch.io/)
- Auto-detect encoding of game files
   
    - Some game packages contain diverse file encodings, and the logic of automatic detection does not work well, so it is better to guide the creators to handle the uploaded packages themselves.
    - For the sake of efficiency the sampling method was used , and it is possible to miss files with different encodings if they exist. And if judging the encoding of each file is not necessary for most games. In case of new games, it is recommended to use the resources suggested by EasyRPG Project to unify file naming and encoding.

### Next
- Discord Integration
    - Register / Login with Discord
    - Channel<->chatroom
    - Discord account->W3itch account->Ynoproject server account
- Account binding
    - We spent extra time on storage issues this week, so this issue was postponed.
    - Main impact: GitHub registered users have to bind their wallets to get token to unlock some games.

## Week 7
May. 15th - 22th
- Discord Integration
    - Register / Login with Discord
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/2I9LXPG.png)
        - We will try to integrate some games with discord accounts.
    - Research on [Fosscord](https://fosscord.com/)
        - > Fosscord is a free and open source program compatible with Discord. It's an in development chat, voice and video platform similar to Slack and Rocket.chat.
        - These are also the direction w3itchio is working on
            - Configurable
            - Selfhostable
            - Decentralized
            - Free & Open Source
            - Encryption
            - Security
            - Privacy
        - Discord compatibilable
            - Many gaming communities will have their own Discord Server
            - Users get used to the Discord style experience
            - Although most users do not feel it, Discord is a private service, the basic control of the community is actually in the hands of Discord, not in the hands of the community members.
            - We think it's good to have a relatively smooth migration solution rather than a rush when the day comes.
       
- Account Binding
    - You can now bind your accounts on other platforms to your w3itchio account
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/g5UYH90.png)
    - Although we ask whether the user is a player or a creator when registering, there's really not much practical use for it yet.
    - Considering the services that players and creators may use, we first provide the GitHub account binding feature commonly used by developers and the Discord account binding feature commonly used by the gaming community
    - If you are a developer, you can now try our [Drone](https://drone.w3itch.io/) service. If you think it's a good idea to push game updates to w3itch.io with Drone (yes, like the preview feature provided by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)), feel free to contact us!

- Search
    - The SEO results were not too good and we found that we were confusing the need to search in site with the need to retrieve us through Google.
    - For example, some API-based solutions that are not conducive to google crawling, but are well suited for in-site search usecase
        - We now try to use [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for in-site search
        - In addition, [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) has been added for Google to crawl.
            - > Data is messy and disconnected. JSON-LD organizes and connects it, creating a better Web.
            - In the long run, this is not only for crawling, but also helps build connections between data. Migrate game, material, creator, player and community data out of walled gardens and provide deposition solutions
            
- About JSON-LD
    - Not many people may know that, in fact, if you view source of itch.io's games, you'll find this data
    
    ``` json 
    // from https://tuyoki.itch.io/soulbeacon
    {"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org\/","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.9","ratingCount":155},"@type":"Product","description":"A small comic being updated leisurely","name":"Soul Beacon of the Netherworld"}
    ```
   - The data is organized according to the json-ld standard, not the schema defined internally by itch.io, is human-friendly, and can be shared anywhere, including saved as offline data. 
   - The downside is that if itch.io shuts down, the data will be inaccessible as well. If the community had a convenient mechanism to crawl the parts they are interested in, build data networks and aggregate feeds based on technologies like IPFS/Arweave, the data would not disappear from the Internet even if individual gateways were out of service.
